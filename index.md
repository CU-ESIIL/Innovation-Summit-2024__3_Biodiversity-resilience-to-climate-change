# Group 3 -- Biodiversity resilience to climate change 

**Project Title: Blip Hunterz**

Question: **In what ways can monitoring and decision-making enhance biodiversity resilience to climate change?**
Specifically: How can we quantify biodiversity resilience to extreme events/changing climate? E.g., using what metrics, looking at different events, locations, management strategies.
Potential follow up Q: How is resilience impacted by restoration efforts following disturbance?

decision-making: where to focus mgt, restoration, and conservation efforts
    
**identify suitable biodiversity data soruces**
* leveraging long term data (e.g., LTER, LTAR, FIA, IMP - NPS inventory, BLM- AIM), including the long-term experiments, citizen science data
* bird breeding atlas
* what are the key climate variables as proxies of climate change?
* to inform decision-making and making policies towards env mgt such as ecological restoration, for instance, wetland and forest restoration for increased resilience
* Use WorldClim data - space for time substitution, to identify areas where climate has changed the most, which areas has changed the most
* Quantifying a biodiversity resilience - how quickly can biodiversity return to the historical avg. 
* use alpha diveristy-based biodiversity indices and measure how much that change over time from the baseline in response to climate change
