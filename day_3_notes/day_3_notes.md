## Morning round-robin
 
 * CO-WY program could be a useful thing to look at after we develop this project/working group
 * CO-WY is very interested in economic development (with climate adaptation as a motivation), so if we have something that applies to workforce development, corporate credits for stuff (carbon, biodiversity), etc. then maybe we have a foothold
