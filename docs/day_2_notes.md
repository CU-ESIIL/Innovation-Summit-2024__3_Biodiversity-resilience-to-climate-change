## Morning round-robin

1. Jen - functional resilience might be something to think about
2. Greg - what happens when systems/communities don't return to the mean
    - Get some datasets and see what they look like
    - Time to return to the new state
    - Some communities are not going to return to prior mean and perhaps are therefore not "resilient"
    - Scrub jay example. There are long-term trends in populations/communities and datasets may not capture that, and these may be in contrast to 
    - Thilina - if we're looking for extreme events those are rare
    - Eric - We should hunt for blips and see what patterns we find. LTER and co-located NEON sites
3. Andy wants to look at the data
4. Julia - using multiple diversity metrics will be important (diversity, richness, functional)
    - Personal projects ok
5. Trifosa - generally interested in the project, data sources, continuing....
6. Thilina - what datasets are we using to identify disturbances/blips
7. Eric - deliverables and future plans. NEON has some basis for supporting work on
    - ecocomDP workshop is in the works, may focus on traits?
    - Maybe we want to do a proposal - ESIIL WGs, [LTER Synthesis group](https://lternet.edu/rfp-2024/), ULTRA-data, SNAPP project

Deliverables:

    * Adding LTER, LTAR, NEON to ecocomDP
    * One-pager? Objective and a few specific aims
        - Science question & identify datasets
        - We could do this by tomorrow?
    * Resilience theory concept paper and a teaching module
    * Proposal for a working group
    * Shiny app for ecocomDP - demonstrating diversity responses, both a teaching tool and exploratory tool
    * Ways to use imagery datasets (imageomics)?
    * What about a local use-case. CO-WY use-case

## Parking lot

1. Do we want to pull trait info (species means) from a database or do we want to find datasets with these traits and quantify from that. This relates to the functional resilience.
2.
